h1. python-textile

python-textile is a Python port of "Textile":https://textile-lang.com/, Dean Allen's humane web text generator.

h2. Installation

@pip install textile@

Dependencies:
* "nh3":https://pypi.org/project/nh3/
* "regex":https://pypi.org/project/regex/ (The regex package causes problems with PyPy, and is not installed as a dependency in such environments. If you are upgrading a textile install on PyPy which had regex previously included, you may need to uninstall it.)

Optional dependencies include:
* "PIL/Pillow":http://python-pillow.github.io/ (for checking image sizes). If needed, install via @pip install 'textile[imagesize]'@

bc.. import textile
>>> s = """
... _This_ is a *test.*
...
... * One
... * Two
... * Three
...
... Link to "Slashdot":http://slashdot.org/
... """
>>> html = textile.textile(s)

	<p><em>This</em> is a <strong>test.</strong></p>
